1. simple animation (keyframes -> object location/rotation/scale)

2. skinned animation in blender (*most* used workflow for animating)

  A. create a mesh (with materials + textures)

  B. rigging ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_animation )
    create "armature == skeleton" (bunch of bones / joints)
    connect skeleton to mesh (assign vertices to bones)
    end result: stil static, but with useful "controls"
      "control" = bone/joint
      //"control" = advanced : blender "driver" (not discussed here)

  C. animating, create animation(s) that move/rotate
    the bones/joints
    - walk
    - run
    - jump
    - idle / breath / stand in place
    - ...

  MakeHuman (maybe, I don't know MakeHuman) https://static.makehumancommunity.org/mpfb.html
  does A and B?

  Mixamo https://www.mixamo.com/#/
  does C

  A,B,C - you just do it yourself
    - or rather: you have people who do A,B,C
