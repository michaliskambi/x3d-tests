Fun with avocado glTF model from glTF-Sample-Models/2.0/Avocado/ ,

- inlined in X3D using Inline, but under Switch (so by default it is not visible)

- and then parts of the avocado are imported and used in X3D.

To know what is EXPORTed from Avocado, load it to view3dscene and save as X3D. At the bottom, you will notice lines like this:

```
EXPORT Avocado_2
EXPORT CastleEncoded_2256_Avocado_d
EXPORT Avocado
```
