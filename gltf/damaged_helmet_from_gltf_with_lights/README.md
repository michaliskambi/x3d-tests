Damaged helmet example from
  https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/ :
  https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/tree/master/2.0/DamagedHelmet/glTF

Converted to X3D using view3dscene .
  DamagedHelmet.x3dv is 100% auto-generated from DamagedHelmet.gltf.
  In view3dcene you could just use

    Inline {
      url "DamagedHelmet.gltf"
    }

  and there's no need to even store DamagedHelmet.x3dv.
  However we store DamagedHelmet.x3dv in the repo to easily test it with other X3D browsers.

Added EnvironmentLight and Background to look lighter,
in DamagedHelmetLights.x3dv .
