and related lighting/texturing "upgrades" of X3D.

Contact me if you'd like an even more open license,
if it's for the good of Web3D standards -- I'll probablly be OK with this.

Note that x3d_3_interesting_tests/ subdirectory has tests that deal only
with functionality already present in X3D 3.
However, it was important to test this functionality,
to know how should be change X3D 4 to make rendering of some tricky stuff reliable and useful.
