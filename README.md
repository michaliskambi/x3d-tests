# x3d-tests

Various X3D tests.

## This repository collects X3D tests unrelated to Castle Game Engine

Michalis maintains another, large collection of X3D tests inside the Castle Game Engine "demo models":

- Get them from https://github.com/castle-engine/demo-models
- See https://castle-engine.sourceforge.io/ about Castle Game Engine.
- See https://castle-engine.sourceforge.io/view3dscene.php about view3dscene, my X3D browser.

But these "demo models" grew into a large collection, developed for various purposes related with Castle Game Engine (demos, CGE inter-operability tests, CGE conformance tests...).

This repository is for X3D tests not connected (primarily) with Castle Game Engine.
